数论题

```
a+b+c = n
a*x=b*y=c*z = n
1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1
yz + zx + xy = xyz
设 x < = y <= z
LHS <= 3yz
=> xyz <= 3yz
=> x<=3 
=> x in [2, 3]

x = 2时，1/y+1/z = 1/2
=> 2y+2z = yz
=> z(y-2) = 2y
=> z = 2y/(y-2) = 2+4/(y-2)
y-2 in [1, 2, 3]
   +--
   | y = 3, z = 6 
=> | y = 4, z = 4
   | y = 6, z = 3 (x)
   +--

x = 3时，1/y+1/z = 2/3
=> 4yz-6(y+z) = 0
=> (2y-3)(2z-3) = 9
   +--
   | y = 2, z = 6 (x)
=> | y = 3, z = 3
   |'
